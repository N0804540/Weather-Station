# Weather-Station

Language: Java

A client-server project focused around weather stations that generate data in set intervals. They then connect to a server class through a port connection
(confirmed via a handshake protocol) and submit data that the server is then capable of displaying to a user via a GUI (created in the Swing Java UI library).
