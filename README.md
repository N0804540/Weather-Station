# Weather-Station

Language: Java

A client-server project focused around weather stations that generate data in set intervals. They then connect to a server class through a port connection
(confirmed via a handshake protocol) and submit data that the server is then capable of displaying to a user via a GUI (created in the Swing Java UI library).

The project itself began as a university group assignment, implementing functionality for the WeatherStation and weatherStationData classes. As the designated "software engineer" of the team, my personal involvement was on the majority of the initial WeatherStation code, the GUI implementation and later formation of the client-server relationship as an extension.
